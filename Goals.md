# Real Companies – Goals & Scope  
*A Victoria 3 total‑conversion mod focused on historical corporations (1836‑1936)*  

---

## 1 . Vision  

> **Bring the real boardroom into the sandbox.**  
> Every country—great or small—should start or eventually gain the corporations that actually shaped its economy, diplomacy, labor politics, and technological progress during the long nineteenth century.  The aim is not a handful of flavourful names but a **living global corporate landscape** whose births, mergers, and rivalries unfold on their authentic historical dates.

---

## 2 . Core Objectives  

| # | Goal | Rationale |
|---|------|-----------|
| **2.1** | **Populate the game with historically‑attested companies across *all* major industries and regions.** | Move beyond the vanilla handful (e.g., Standard Oil, Colt, Mitsubishi) to hundreds of firms in steel, textiles, agriculture, shipping, banking, chemicals, consumer goods, electronics, etc. |
| **2.2** | **Respect authentic founding years and headquarters locations.** | Boston Manufacturing (1813) should already exist in 1836; Ford Motor should not appear until 1903.  This preserves the tech‑tree pacing and creates recognizable “eras” of industrialization. |
| **2.3** | **Auto‑spawn companies via scripted history/events—no player click needed.** | Maintains immersion and avoids UI spam; also lets AI nations follow plausible industrial paths. |
| **2.4** | **Increase each country’s maximum company slots.** | Required to house the greatly expanded roster; final cap TBD during balancing. |
| **2.5** | **Provide high‑resolution PNG logos and localized names for every firm.** | Visual authenticity in the Company Lens and out‑liner; easier recognition for players. |
| **2.6** | **Minimise performance cost.** | Tight company scopes (1‑2 associated building types) and longer AI evaluation intervals keep tick time healthy even with ~10× more firms. |

## 5 . Out‑of‑Scope (Initial Release)  

* Fantasy or anachronistic corporations (e.g., Apple, SpaceX). Will be considered in 1.1 with a toggleable setting.
* Post‑1936 entities unless they descend directly from an in‑scope firm.  
* Detailed economic rebalance of product prices or tech costs (handled by other mods).  

---

## 6 . Contribution & Asset Pipeline  

1. **Historical research sheets** – foundation date, founders, HQ state, associated buildings.  
2. **Logo production** – 256×256 & 64×64 PNG, transparent background, vintage palette when possible.  
3. **YAML localisation** – English base; community translations encouraged.  
4. **Git workflow** – feature branches per country or industry, pull‑request review before merge to `main`.  

---

## 7 . Success Criteria  

* **Immersion:** Players recognize iconic names at the correct moments in history.  
* **Balance:** Additional firms enrich, not overwhelm, AI decision‑making and market dynamics.  
* **Performance:** Average daily tick time stays within ±10 % of vanilla for a 1936 save.  
* **Accessibility:** No manual steps required; zero GUI pop‑ups unless deliberately scripted for flavour events.

> **Real Companies** turns Victoria 3 into the boardroom simulator its industrial sandbox deserves—where Krupp battles Bethlehem Steel, Mitsui trades coal with Cargill, and a Meiji‑era textile boom paves the way for Toyoda looms to become Toyota cars, all on their historical timelines.
